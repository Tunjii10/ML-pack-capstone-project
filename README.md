# Hamoye-capstone-project
This is the capstone project by the Ml-pack group in the Hamoye Data Science Internship Cohort 2021
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the whole world, overwhelming healthcare systems - unprepared for such intense and lengthy request for ICU beds, professionals, personal protection equipment and healthcare resources.
The aim of this project is to predict which covid-19 patients will need intensive care unit support
This in turn will provide tertiary and quaternary hospitals with the most accurate answer, so ICU resources can be arranged or patient transfer can be scheduled.
